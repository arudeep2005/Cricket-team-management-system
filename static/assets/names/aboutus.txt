We are a team of three dedicated to creating a simple and efficient \nCricket Tournament Management System that stores and manages \ninformation related to players, teams, matches, \nand statistics. Our system allows for random generation of player \nand team details, generation of match schedules, \nand the ability to view player and team statistics, as well as \nmatch scorecards. Our system is designed to handle a round-robin \ntournament system with ease. This is a term-project for \nSoftware Engineering Lab 2023 made by \nAnit Mangal, Ratan Junior and Gorantla Thoyajakshi.
